GetXPaths
======

This project, written in Javascript, is for web spiders/scraps or just for fun :)
It's allows a user to select given HTML elements in a page, and returns the xpath of those elements.

The interface that allows a user to select an element is clear and simple - when hovering over an element, it get surrounded by a red border, allowing to user to know which element is being selected.

After selecting the needed elements, a dictionary with the xpaths is sent to the server, allowing a crawler to easily understand a page structure.
