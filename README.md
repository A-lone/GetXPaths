GetXPaths
======

This project, written in jquery, is for web spiders/scraps or just for fun :) 
The main idea is to get the source code of html page from server side via AJAX, 
and then print the html on the jquery page.
now the user has the ability to choose elements from the page and get an dictionary 
from jquery of all the xpaths he had chosen.
